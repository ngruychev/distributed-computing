# Research questions

Our main research question will be:

- What are the best practices for deploying, monitoring, and managing Kubernetes-based distributed systems to ensure security and performance?

And our sub questions are the following:

- How can we design an efficient deployment strategy for Kubernetes clusters
  that considers factors such as resource utilization, scalability, and fault tolerance?
- What are the recommended security configurations and controls for securing Kubernetes clusters,
  including access control, network policies, and container runtime security?
- What role does compliance management play in ensuring that Kubernetes-based distributed systems meet
  regulatory requirements and industry standards for security and data protection?
- what encryption mechanisms  should be used in this project?

# Research strategies

- Experimental Research
  - Design controlled experiments to compare the performance of
    different communication mechanisms within a Kubernetes cluster.

- Survey Research:
  - Collect feedback from practitioners and experts in the field to understand their
    experiences and preferences regarding communication strategies in Kubernetes.

- Case Study Research:
  - Investigate real-world implementations of Kubernetes clusters in organizations
    to examine how they handle information distribution and communication challenges.

- Action Research:
  - Collaborate with industry partners or open-source communities to implement and
    evaluate new communication protocols or tools in Kubernetes environments, iteratively refining the approaches based on feedback and observations.
